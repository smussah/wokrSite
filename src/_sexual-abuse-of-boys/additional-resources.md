This page has links to other organizations and websites, as well as to articles, chapters and books by researchers and therapists.

It also includes links to the websites of two excellent documentary films and a couple of leaders in this work.

There are many other resources on my site that could be helpful to men who experienced unwanted or abusive sexual experiences as boys, and people who care about them.

## Organizations & Websites

[1in6](https://www.1in6.org) - Their mission: To help men who have experienced sexual abuse or assault in childhood live healthier, happier lives. Their website has lots of information for men who've had such experiences and people who care about them. (During my time with 1in6, I wrote most of the pages on the site.)

[Living Well](https://www.livingwell.org.au/) is a great Australian organization and website that, like 1in6.org, has lots of information for men sexually abused as boys and for people who care about them.

[MaleSurvivor](http://www.malesurvivor.org/) - Their mission: "We are committed to preventing, healing, and eliminating all forms of sexual victimization of boys and men through treatment, research, education, advocacy, and activism." Their site has many helpful resources, including [A Consumers Guide To Therapist Shopping](http://www.malesurvivor.org/consumers-guide/), and the organization offers [Weekends and Days of Recovery](http://www.malesurvivor.org/weekends-of-recovery/)&nbsp;several times a year.

[Boys and Men Healing](http://bigvoicepictures.com/production-3/boys-and-men-healing/) is Kathy Barbini's amazing documentary film, which in my opinion (and many others') is the best on this issue.

[Stories of Silence: Recovering from Boyhood Sexual Abuse](http://www.storiesofsilence.org/) is Ethan Delavan's powerful documentary.

[British Columbia Society for Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse](http://bc-malesurvivors.com/) - Their mission is providing "therapeutic services for males who have been sexually abused at some time in their lives." This includes direct services to men and their significant others; providing training to help establish new agencies for men with histories of sexual abuse in British Columbia; and consulting with community and government groups on prevention, treatment, therapy, and other matters relating to sexual abuse of males.

[The Next Step Counseling and Training, and Small Wonder Books](http://www.nextstepcounseling.org/) - This is the website of Mike Lew, M.Ed. and Thom Harrigan, LICSW, and includes information about their center in Newton, Massachusetts, workshops for that they offer around the world, and Lew's most recent book, [Leaping upon the mountains: Men proclaiming victory over child sexual abuse](http://www.nextstepcounseling.org/books2.htm#leaping). Lew is also the author of [Victims No Longer](https://www.amazon.com/Victims-No-Longer-Classic-Recovering/dp/006053026X/ref_=nosim&amp;tag=jimhoppercom-20), considered by many to be the best book ever written about and for men sexually abused as boys.

[Richard Gartner, Ph.D.](http://www.richardgartner.com/about.html)&nbsp;has written books and articles on the sexual abuse of males and their treatment in therapy, and is past president of MaleSurvivor. His web site has many resources, including writings and testimony by Gartner on a variety of issues relevant to males with histories of sexual abuse.

[Just Detention International (JDI)](http://justdetention.org/) is a human rights organization that seeks to end sexual abuse in all forms of detention. Their site has many informative and educational documents on prison rape, including an extensive publications section.
