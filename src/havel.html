<a name="global">"One</a> evening not long ago I was sitting in an outdoor
restaurant by the
water. My chair was almost identical to the chairs they have in
restaurants by
the Vltava River in Prague. They were playing the same rock music
they play in
Prague restaurants. I saw advertisements I'm familiar with back
home.<P>

"Above all, I was surrounded by young people who were
similarly dressed, who drank
familiar-looking drinks, and who behaved as casually as their
contemporaries in
Prague. Only their complexion and their facial features were
different &#150; for I
was in Singapore.<P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"I sat there thinking about this
and again &#150; for the umpteenth time &#150; I
realized an almost banal truth: that we now live in a single
global civilization.</font><P>

"The identity of this civilization does not lie merely in
similar forms of dress,
or similar drinks, or in the constant buzz of the same commercial
music all
around the world, or even in international
advertising.<P>

"It lies in something deeper: thanks to the modern idea
of constant
progress, with its inherent expansionism, and to the rapid
evolution of
science that comes directly from it, our planet has, for the
first time
in the long history of the human race, been covered in the space
of a
very few decades by a single civilization &#150; one that is
essentially
technological.<P>

<font color="#A62A2A"><a name="webs">"The</a> world is now enmeshed in webs of
telecommunications networks consisting of millions tiny threads
or capillaries that not only transmit information of all kinds
at lightning speed, but also convey integrated models of social,
political and economic behavior.</font><P>

"They are conduits for legal norms, as well as for
billions and
billions of dollars crisscrossing the world while remaining
invisible even
to those who deal directly with them.<P>

"The life of the human race is completely interconnected
not only
in the informational sense but in the causal sense as
well.<P>

"Anecdotally, I could illustrate this by reminding
you &#150; since I've
already mentioned Singapore &#150; that today all it takes is a single
shady
transaction initiated by a devious bank clerk in Singapore to
bring down
a bank on the other side of the world....<P>

"More than that, the capillaries that have so radically
integrated
this civilization also convey information about certain modes of
human
co-existence that have proven their worth, like democracy,
respect for
human rights, the rule of law, the laws of the
market-place.<P>

"Such information flows around the world and, in varying
degrees,
takes root in different places....<P>

"In theory, at least, [this global civilization] gives
people
not only the capacity for worldwide communication, but also a
coordinated
means of defending themselves against common dangers. It can
also, in an
unprecedented way, make our life on this earth easier and open up
to us
hitherto unexplored horizons in our knowledge of ourselves and
the world
we live in.<P>

"And yet there is something not quite right about
it....<P>

"I want to focus today on the source of the dangers
that threaten humanity despite this global civilization, and
often directly
because of it. Above all, I would like to speak about the ways in
which these
dangers can be confronted.<P>

<font color="#A62A2A"><a name="thin">"Many</a> of the great problems we face today, as far as I
understand
them, have their origin in the fact that this global
civilization, though
in evidence everywhere, is not more than a thin veneer over the
sum total
of human awareness, if I may put it that way.</font><P>

"This civilization is immensely fresh, young, new, and
fragile,
and the human spirit has accepted it with dizzying alacrity,
without
itself changing in any essential way.<P>

"Humanity has evolved over long millennia in all manner
of
civilizations and cultures that gradually, in very diverse ways,
shaped our habits of mind, our relationship to the world, our
models
of behavior and the values we accept and recognize.<P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"In essence, the new, single epidermis of world
civilization
merely covers or conceals the immense variety of cultures, of
peoples,
of religious worlds, of historical traditions and historically
formed
attitudes, all of which in a sense lie 'beneath' it.</font><P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"At the same time, even as the veneer of world
civilization
expands, this 'underside' of humanity, this hidden dimension of
it,
demands more and more clearly to be heard and to be granted a
right to
life.</font><P>

"And thus, while the world as a whole increasingly
accepts the new habit of global civilization, another
contradictory process is taking place: ancient traditions are
reviving, different religions and cultures are awakening to new
ways of being, seeking new room to exist, and struggling with
growing fervor to realize what is unique to them and what makes
them different from others. Ultimately they seek to give their
individuality a political expression.<P>

<a name="chal">"What</a> follows from all of this?<P>

"It is my belief that this state of affairs contains a clear
challenge
not only to the Euro-American world but to our present-day
civilization
as a whole.<P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"It is a challenge to this
civilization to start understanding itself as a multicultural
and multipolar civilization, whose meaning lies not in
undermining the individuality of different spheres of culture
and civilization but in allowing them to be more completely
themselves.
</font><P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"This will only be possible,
even conceivable, if we all accept a basic code of mutual
co-existence, a kind of continuum we can all share,
one that will enable us to go on living side by side.</font><P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"Yet such a code won't stand a chance if it is merely the
product of the few who then proceed to force it on the rest.</font><P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"It must be an expression of the authentic will of
everyone, growing out of the genuine spiritual roots hidden beneath the skin of our
common, global civilization.</font><P>

"If it is merely disseminated through the capillaries of
this
skin, the way Coca-cola ads are &#150; as a commodity offered by some
to
others &#150; such a code can hardly be expected to take hold in any
profound
or universal way.<P>

"But is humanity capable of such an undertaking?<P>

"Is it not hopelessly utopian idea?....<P>

"I don't know.<P>

"But I have not lost hope.<P>


<a name="comm">"I</a> have not lost hope because I am persuaded again and
again that
lying dormant in the deepest roots of most, if not all, cultures
there is
an essential similarity, something that could be made &#150; if the
will to do
so existed &#150; a genuinely unifying starting point for that new code
of human
co-existence that would be firmly anchored in the great diversity
of
human traditions.<P>

<font color="#A62A2A">"Don't we find somewhere in the foundations of most
religions and
cultures, though they may take a thousand and one distinct
forms, common
elements such as a respect for what transcends us, whether we
mean the
mystery of Being, or a moral order that stands above us; certain
imperatives
that come to us from heaven, or from nature, or from our own
hearts; a
belief that our deeds will live past us; respect for our
neighbors, for our
families, for certain natural authorities; respect for human
dignity and
for nature; a sense of solidarity and benevolence toward guests
who come
with good intentions?</font><P>

"Isn't the common, ancient origin or human roots of our
diverse
spiritualities, each of which is merely another kind of human
understanding
of the same reality, the thing that can genuinely bring people of
different
cultures together?....<P>

"Naturally, I am not suggesting that modern people be
compelled
to worship ancient deities and accept rituals they have long
since
abandoned.<P>

"I am suggesting something quite different: we must come
to
understand the deep mutual connection or kinship between the
various
forms of our spirituality. We must recollect our original
spiritual
and moral substance, which grew out of the same essential
experience
of humanity.<P>

"I believe that this is the only way to achieve a genuine
renewal
of our sense of responsibility for ourselves and for the world.
And at the
same time, it is the only way to achieve a deeper understanding
among
cultures that will enable them to work together in a truly
ecumenical
way to create a new order for the world."<P>
