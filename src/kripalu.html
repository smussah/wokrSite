This program is an &ldquo;intensive format&rdquo; workshop including more learning hours than the average 5-day course.</p><p>Learn how Buddhist- and neuroscience-informed meditation and yoga techniques can cultivate mindful embodiment and transform habitual thoughts, emotions, and behaviors into openings for freedom, love, and happiness.</p><p>Drawing on contemporary neuroscience and traditional Buddhist psychology, this workshop focuses on seven key dimensions of human experience and their corresponding brain circuitries: aversion, seeking, satisfaction, bodily awareness, executive functioning, relationships, and &ldquo;default mode&rdquo; processes. Jim Hopper and David Schouela interweave theory with practice to promote an experiential understanding of these concepts.</p><p>Explore Buddhist practices, including concentration, mindfulness, loving-kindness, and mind-training meditations, and contemporary yoga practices that can harness and transform our brain circuitries and the relationships between them. Jim and Dana provide handouts for every presentation and step-by-step instructions for each practice.</p><p>See also our Kripalu website bio pages: <a href="https://www.kripalu.org/presenter/V0004678/jim_hopper">Jim Hopper</a>, <a href="https://kripalu.org/presenter/V0009499/david_schouela">David Schouela</a></p><h3 id="more-info">More info:</h3><p>We invite you to join us for this innovative and highly experiential workshop at a leading retreat center for yoga and health.</p><p>Our presentations will be accompanied by plenty of time for questions and discussion.
