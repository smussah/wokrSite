      Neural correlates of reexperiencing, avoidance, and dissociation in PTSD:
      Symptom dimensions and emotion dysregulation in responses to script-driven
      trauma imagery.
    authors: 'Hopper JW, Frewen PA, van der Kolk BA, Lanius RA.'
    details: 'J Trauma Stress 2007; 22:713-725'
    summary: >-
      This paper's introduction and discussion sections address the complexity
      of subjective and brain processes involved in responses to trauma
      reminders. Thus they may be interesting and useful to people trying to
      understand the biological dimensions of PTSD and child abuse effects.

      Individual differences in a husband and wife who developed PTSD after a
      motor vehicle accident: A functional MRI case study.
    authors: 'Lanius RA, Hopper JW, Menon RS.'
    details: 'Am J Psychiat 2003; 160:667-669'
    summary: >-
      This short paper demonstrates that people can have very different
      responses, including brain responses, to the same traumatic event. The
      findings also suggest that the functional significance of a response, and
      of a person's symptoms, rather than any particular diagnosis the person
      can be given, are keys to understanding the brain processes involved.

      Recall of emotional states in posttraumatic stress disorder: An fMRI
      investigation
    authors: 'Lanius RA, Williamson PC, Hopper JW... Menon R.'
    details: 'Biol Psychiatry 2003; 53:204-210'
    summary: >-
      The findings reported here suggest a major limitation of biological models
      of PTSD that focus exclusively on fear and leave out the full range of
      human emotional experiences and processes that may be altered.

      Reexperiencing/Hyperaroused and Dissociative States in Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder
    authors: 'Lanius RA, Hopper JW (2008).'
    details: 'Psychiatric Times, Vol. 25, No. 13'
    summary: >-
      This brief overview paper for psychiatrists and other clinicians was
      'invited' by editors of <i>Psychiatric Times,</i> but not peer reviewed.
      It includes suggested resources for working with clients who suffer from
      PTSD and dissociation.

      The Responses to Script-Driven Imagery Scale (RSDI): Assessment of state
      posttraumatic symptoms for psychobiological and treatment research
    authors: 'Hopper JW, Frewen PA, Sack M, Lanius RA, van der Kolk BA.'
    details: 'J Psychopathol Behav Assess 2007; 20:713-725'
    summary: >-
      This paper introduces a scale that I developed primarily for research
      applications. However, parts of the introduction and discussion may be
      interesting and useful to non-researchers too, because they address the
      complexity of responses to strong trauma reminders in PTSD, and the
      limitations of traditional (structured interview) methods for assessing
      the effectiveness of treatments for PTSD.

      Probing reward function in posttraumatic stress disorder: Expectancy and
      satisfaction with monetary gains and losses
    authors: 'Hopper JW, Pitman RK,... Elman IE.'
    details: 'J Psychiatry Res 2008; 42:802-807'
    summary: >-
      This study (like other work by my colleague Igor Elman) suggests that PTSD
      can involve impairment of the brain's 'reward circuitry.' This circuitry
      includes the circuitries of seeking and satisfaction (see <a
      href="/the-brain/overview/">The Brain</a>) and underlies our capacities to
      want, expect, seek and enjoy potentially rewarding experiences.
      Impairments of this circuitry's functioning may partly account for
      'emotional numbing' and depression symptoms of traumatized people.

      Retrieving, assessing, and classifying traumatic memories: A preliminary
      report on three case studies of a new standardized method
    authors: 'Hopper JW, van der Kolk BA.'
    details: 'J Aggression, Maltreatment, Trauma 2001; 4:33-71'
    summary: >-
      In this paper we review research methods for retrieving and assessing the
      characteristics of traumatic memories, discuss their limitations, and
      introduce a method that employs a standardized approach long used in
      research on the biology of PTSD (i.e., script-driven imagery). We then
      present three case examples to illustrate the benefits of this method.
      Even for non-researchers this paper will clarify some important things
      about how memories are retrieved differently in different situations, and
      about their potential changes over time.

      Exploring the nature of traumatic memory: Combining clinical knowledge
      with laboratory methods
    authors: 'van der Kolk BA, Hopper JW, Osterman JE.'
    details: 'J Aggression, Maltreatment, Trauma 2001; 4:9-31'
    summary: >-
      In this paper we begin by reviewing key historical and scientific issues,
      including why – for ethical reasons, not scientific ones – researchers
      cannot study traumatic memories that have been created in the laboratory.
      We then explore the implications of this fact, summarize a study of
      memories of a unique traumatized sample (people who woke up during
      surgery), and suggest a way forward in which clinical knowledge can be
      combined with laboratory methods to further the science of traumatic
      memory.

      Preliminary evidence for parasympathetic influence on basal heart rate in
      posttraumatic stress disorder
    authors: 'Hopper JW, Spinazzola J, Simpson WB, van der Kolk BA.'
    details: 'J Psychosom Res 2006; 60:83-90'
    summary: >-
      With this study I presented evidence that PTSD is associated with altered
      functioning of the parasymapthetic branch of the autonomic nervous system,
      not just the sympathetic branch that had long been the focus of
      researchers. As we concluded in the abstract, "These findings suggest that
      a substantial proportion of those with PTSD may not have elevated basal
      HRs. Furthermore, among those who do exhibit elevated HR, there may be a
      parasympathetic contribution that is independent of any sympathetic one."

      Low respiratory sinus arrhythmia and prolonged psychophysiological arousal
      in PTSD: Heart rate dynamics and individual differences in arousal
      regulation
    authors: 'Sack M, Hopper JW, Lamprecht F.'
    details: 'Biol Psychiatry 2004; 55:284-290'
    summary: >-
      This study, with my German colleague Martin Sack, was the first to find
      decreased parasympathetic activity in physiological responses to a trauma
      reminder in people with PTSD. We also found an association between low
      resting parasympathetic activity and sustained physiological arousal in
      response to the trauma reminder. In short, we found that decreased
      parasympathetic activity, not just increased sympathetic activity, may
      account for the dysregulations of arousal and emotion commonly observed in
      PTSD.

      Factors in the cycle of violence: Gender rigidity and emotional
      constriction
    authors: 'Lisak D, Hopper J, Song P.'
    details: 'J Trauma Stress 1996; 9:721-743'
    summary: >-
      Why do some abused boys but not others go on to perpetrate violence
      against others? In this study we found, as stated in the abstract, "most
      perpetrators were abused, but most abused men did not perpetrate. Both
      sexually and physically abused men who perpetrated manifested
      significantly more gender rigidity and emotional constriction than abused
      nonperpetrators. Men who reported abuse but not perpetration demonstrated
      significantly less gender rigidity, less homophobia, and less emotional
      constriction than nonabused men."

      Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular
      ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study
    authors: 'Hopper JW, Su Z, Looby AR... Lukas SE.'
    details: 'Drug Alcohol Depend 2006; 85:221-235'
    summary: >-
      Among policy makers and researchers, there have been tendencies to assume
      the worst about patterns of intoxicating and illegal drug use. With
      respect to MDMA or 'escstasy,' many have believed and claimed that use of
      MDMA is associated with indiscriminate use of other drugs at the same
      time. For this study we collected data on drug use in real time, via
      'experience sampling.' We found that "Use of ecstasy on a particular night
      may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other
      intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use
      may simply reflect a 'natural history' of drug-use nights that begins with
      alcohol,  progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug
      use."

      Mindfulness-oriented interventions for trauma: Integrating contemplative
      methods
    authors: 'Follette VM, Briere J, Rozelle D, Hopper, JW, & Rome DI (Eds).'
    details: 'NY: Guilford Press, 2015'
    summary: >-
      Grounded in research and clinical wisdom, this book covers a range of ways
      to integrate contemplative practices into trauma treatment. Like my
      co-editors, I invited and edited several of the 22 chapters, and wrote two
      of them (see below). There are chapters on Dialectical Behavior Therapy
      (DBT), Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and lovingkindness
      meditation for veterans, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Internal
      Family Systems (IFS), Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TSY) and other approaches
      that have contemplative aspects.

      Harnessing the seeking, satisfaction and embodiment circuitries in
      contemplative approaches to healing trauma
    authors: Hopper JW.
    details: 'NY: Guilford Press, 2015'
    summary: >-
      This chapter offers an understanding of some key brain and psychological
      processes involved in trauma, in suffering and healing, and in potentially
      transformative contemplative practices – especially those for cultivating
      mindfulness, kindness, compassion, and love. The framework I share draws
      on knowledge from many scientific, clinical and contemplative traditions,
      and is a way of understanding human suffering, healing and happiness in
      terms of four key brain circuitries, and in terms of cycles of suffering
      and cycles of healing involving particular relationships among those
      circuitries.  It can help clinicians to understand – and to help their
      clients understand – posttraumatic symptoms and suffering, including
      addictions and the emotion regulation problems of complex trauma. It also
      explains potential pathways to healing, including how therapeutic
      interventions and contemplative practices can harness key brain
      circuitries to bring healing and happiness.

      Intensive Vipassana meditation practice: An intervention with promise for
      traumatized prisoners.
    authors: 'Phillips J, Hopper JW.'
    details: 'NY: Guilford Press, 2015'
    summary: >-
      This chapter, co-authored with my colleague Jenny Phillips, presents an
      approach to healing traumatized prisoners that is new to prison-based
      trauma intervention but over 2,000 years old: an intensive, 10-day
      Vipassana meditation course that, since 2002, has been conducted inside a
      maximum-security prison in Alabama. We make the case that intensive,
      traditional and communal Vipassana practice makes good sense and holds
      great promise as a short-term prison-based trauma treatment – one that can
      provide stabilization, skills development, and safe and effective
      opportunities to process traumatic memories.
