      Also published on my blog (see below) just before the Senate Judiciary
      Committee hearing with Dr. Blasey Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. If I had been
      permitted to provide my expert testimony in the hearing, these would have
      been my remarks, which apply not just to memories of sexual assault but to
      memories of military combat and other traumas too.

      On this blog hosted by Psychology Today, I share my latest thinking on how
      being attacked can alter thinking, behavior, and memory formation in the
      midst of sexual assaults – and some important implications for justice,
      healing, and prevention.

      I gave this brief presentation for a roundtable discussion held during a
      two-day event focused on transforming how the television and film industry
      deals with sexual assault and harassment. The event took place in Toronto
      in December of 2017 and was hosted by #AfterMeToo and The Globe and Mail.

      In this 3-minute video, I explain how alcohol and drug intoxication can
      contribute to sexual assault memories that are both incomplete and
      accurate, and how the level of intoxication matters.

      Published by The Washington Post in June 2015, this brief essay explains
      basic brain responses to being attacked, including sexually. It also has
      links to key scientific review articles on the brain bases and
      evolutionary origins of commonly misunderstood effects of the defense/fear
      circuitry taking over: impairment of the prefrontal cortex, survival
      reflexes (e.g., freezing, tonic immobility) and ineffective habit
      behaviors.
  - title: Neurobiology of Trauma &amp; Sexual Assault - Key Points for Investigators
    source: YouTube
    info: >-
      In this brief video I answer questions about commonly misunderstood or
      overlooked brain-based responses during sexual assault, and discuss the
      implications for investigators.

      In this in-depth YouTube video, I explain how the brain impacts of sexual
      assault shape victims’ experiences, behaviors, and memories, including
      with embedded videos that illustrate key effects (e.g., survival
      reflexes). It's a version of most my in-demand training that gets rave
      reviews from civilian and military police, attorneys and victim advocates,
      higher education administrators, etc. (I start talking about the brain at
      9:10, but what comes before sets the stage and is important, especially
      because I clarify that empowering and connecting with victims does not
      mean being biased as an investigator, adjudicator, etc.).

      In these two 90-minute webinars, I talk viewers through the slides and
      videos in Part 1: Experience and Behavior, and Part 2: Experience and
      Memory. I cover the same material as my YouTube video but in greater
      depth, especially on memory issues. Presented in September 2016, these
      webinars are available for free in EVAWI’s webinar archive.  (There is a
      quick and simple registration process, so EVAWI can track who is accessing
      the materials and report to their funding agency.) See also the
      "Neurobiology of  Trauma" FAQ I wrote for EVAWI, below.

      I wrote this FAQ to accompany the two-part webinar series on this topic
      (see above). It has answers to 16 common questions covering a variety of
      issues that are sometimes sources of confusion.

      This provides detailed information for those conducting investigative
      interviews with people reporting sexual assault. It includes sections on
      brain-based effects on memories, fundamental interviewing principles, and
      techniques for improving interviews and the evidence collected. Before
      using this watch my YouTube video, "Neurobiology of Trauma and Sexual
      Assault" (see above).

      This provides options for answering sexual assault victims' common
      questions with brain-based explanations, which can increase understanding
      and reduce shame and self-blame. Before using this handout, watch my
      YouTube video, "Neurobiology of Trauma and Sexual Assault" (see above).

<p class="editable">Why don't many people fight or yell when they're being raped?<br /><br />Why are memories of sexual assault so often fragmentary and confusing?</p>

<p class="editable">Is the brain&rsquo;s response to attack essentially the same &ndash; controlled by the defense/fear circuitry, running on reflexes and habits &ndash; during sexual assault, physical assault, and military combat?<br /><br />The answers have big implications for people who've been sexually assaulted, for those who investigate and prosecute such crimes, and for everyone else who knows or works with someone who's been sexually assaulted.</p>

<p class="editable">These are issues that I address as a consultant and trainer, and here I provide answers via writings and videos, as well as handouts for professionals.<br /><br />The answers, it turns out, are the same in every culture. Around the world, the most common responses of people during sexual assaults are basically the same.<br /><br />Evolution sculpted them into our brains long before we were sophisticated enough to create cultures, long before we began to misunderstand and misjudge sexual assault survivors with culture-based expectations of how women and men &ldquo;should&rdquo; respond during assaults and remember them later.<br />&nbsp;</p>
