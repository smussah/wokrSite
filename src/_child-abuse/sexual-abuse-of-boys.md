This section of my site is for men who've had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences as boys and those who care about them.

This is an area I've studied for more than 25 years, and one to which I have devoted considerable work, including for the nonprofit 1in6 - as a founding board member, long-time adviser and main writer for the website. (Several pages on this site were first written for 1in6.org.)

> You are not alone.

As found on the menu (at right or bottom), this section has pages on [statistics](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/statistics/), some [key facts](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/facts-about-sexual-abuse-of-boys/) that are still unknown to many people, how the impacts of such experiences [can be different for males](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/how-it-can-be-different-for-men/), how [being male can make it hard to heal](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/how-being-male-can-make-it-hard-to-heal/), [potential long-term effects](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/potential-long-term-effects/) and some words of [guidance and hope](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/guidance-and-hope/) from other men who've been through this.

> There are people who understand and can help.

Other pages under [Unwanted or Abusive Childhood Experiences](/child-abuse/overview/) and elsewhere on my site also provide information and resources that can be helpful to men dealing with this issue and those who care about them.

Finally, see [Additional Resources](/child-abuse/sexual-abuse-of-boys/additional-resources/) for organizations and other resources.
