This page is mostly links to websites, but I also suggest some books and provide detailed information on three hotlines for those seeking immediate help.

See also pages with&nbsp;[Resources for Parents & Caregivers](/child-abuse/resources-for-parents-and-caregivers/), [Resources for Family & Friends](/child-abuse/resources-for-family-and-friends/), and the [Healing & Happiness](/healing-and-happiness/) section, which has resources for finding and evaluating therapists or counselors.

## Immediate Help

If you need *immediate* information about and/or connection to resources in your own community, here are four 24-hour toll-free hotlines that you can call, three in the US and one in the UK:

**Childhelp USA's National Child Abuse Hotline** 1-800-422-4453

Childhelp USA is a non-profit organization "dedicated to meeting the physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual needs of abused and neglected children." Its programs and services include this hotline, which children can call with complete anonymity and confidentiality. For more information, including what to expect if you call, see [Hotline](https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/)&nbsp;and other helpful information at their web site. From the site: "The Childhelp USA&reg; National Child Abuse Hotline is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Don't be afraid to call. No one is silly or unimportant to us. If something is bothering you or you want information, CALL!"

**Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN)** 800-656-4673 (HOPE)

[RAINN](http://www.rainn.org/)&nbsp;has a 24-hour National Sexual Assault Hotline and a [National Sexual Assault *Online* Hotline](http://www.rainn.org/get-help/national-sexual-assault-online-hotline) (chat) staffed with RAINN's own trained volunteers and paid staff members who also have knowledge of sexual abuse issues and services, including those specific to males. The phone hotline automatically links callers to *local* counseling centers in their area with trained staff members who know about the effects of unwanted or abusive childhood sexual experiences and available local services. However, someone answering the phone at a local center may&nbsp;*not* understand issues and concerns specific to men, and may not know any local therapists or clinics qualified to help men.&nbsp;*All calls are confidential, and callers may remain anonymous if they wish.*

**National Domestic Violence/Abuse Hotline** 800-799-SAFE; 800-799-7233; 800-787-3224 TDD

This is a 24-hour-a-day hotline, staffed by trained volunteers who are ready to connect people with emergency help in their own communities, including emergency services and shelters. The staff can also provide information and referrals for a variety of non-emergency services, including counseling for adults and children, and assistance in reporting abuse. They have an extensive database of domestic violence treatment providers in all US states and territories. Many staff members speak languages besides English, and they have 24-hour access to translators for approximately 150 languages. For the hearing impaired, there is a TDD number. This is a good resource for people who are experiencing or have experienced domestic violence or abuse, or who suspect that someone they know is being abused (though it is not perfect, and may not have the best number in your area). *All calls to the hotline are confidential, and callers may remain anonymous if they wish.*

**ChildLine (UK)** 0800 1111

"[ChildLine](http://www.childline.org.uk/) is the free helpline for children and young people in the UK. Children and young people can call us on 0800 1111 to talk about any problem â€“ our counsellors are always here to help you sort it out."

## Book Recommendations

[How Long Does It Hurt? A Guide to Recovering from Incest and Sexual Abuse for Teenagers, Their Friends, and Their Families](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1555426743/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20), by Cynthia Mather, Kristina Debye, Judy Wood, and Eliana Gill. This book was written by an incest survivor, and provides step-by-step guidance for sexually abused teenagers. It has a great deal of knowledge and resources to help teenagers understand what they are going through and overcome feelings of isolation, confusion, and self-doubt to truly heal.

*[It Happened to Me: A Teen's Guide to Overcoming Sexual Abuse](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1572242795/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20)*, by William Lee Carter. This workbook is written for teenagers, and has effective exercises help them learn about the different aspects of trauma, clarify their own ideas and beliefs, and explore new ways of feeling and relating. The author is a psychologist who works with sexually abused teens on a daily basis. His approach is very positive. The exercises focus on gaining the strength and confidence needed to reshape one's self-image, connect with others in healthy ways, and develop the skills needed to realize one's full potential.

*[Growing Beyond Survival: A Self-Help Toolkit for Managing Traumatic Stress](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1886968098/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20)*, by Elizabeth Vermilyea .If you want to start learning and practicing the self-regulation skills essential to recovering from the effects of child abuse, or to build on progress you are already making, particularly if you struggle with dissociation, I recommend this book. To learn more about the book and/or order it directly from the publisher (for a higher price than Amazon), go to the [Growing Beyond Survival](http://www.sidran.org/shop/books/growing-beyond-survival-a-self-help-toolkit-for-managing-traumatic-stress-second-edition/) page of the Sidran Press catalog.

*[Trauma and Recovery](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465087302/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20)*, by Judith L. Herman. First published in 1992, this classic will always be one of the best books on psychological trauma and recovery, particularly extreme child abuse. Herman integrates a great deal of research with decades of clinical wisdom and some thought-provoking historical and political perspectives. *Trauma and Recovery* is appropriate for survivors of child abuse and other interpersonal traumas, as well as clinicians and the general reader. I especially recommend this book to students and others just beginning to learn about child abuse and how people recover from these experiences. Though a lot has been learned since Herman wrote this book, it has easily stood the test of time.

[*The Body Keeps the Score*](http://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20/), by Bessel van der Kolk. Published in 2014 this book became an instant classic and *New York Times* Bestseller, and for good reason: van der Kolk conveys decades of clinical experience and wisdom, along with a good deal of science, on psychological trauma and its treatment. He has never been shy about pushing forward the edges of knowledge and treatment, and this brilliant book is helping shift popular and professional understanding of trauma and its treatment beyond the usual confines.

The following two books offer a wealth of helpful information, including explanations of post-traumatic stress disorder and related problems, and many great techniques for managing trauma-related emotions, memories and various other symptoms and problems commonly struggled with by people who were abused as children.

#### [The PTSD Workbook: Simple, Effective Techniques for Overcoming Traumatic Stress Symptoms](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1572242825/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20), by Mary Beth Williams and Soili Poijula

#### [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0737302658/ref=nosim/?tag=jimhoppercom-20), by Glenn Schiraldi

"Established in June 1997, the Center for Sex Offender Management's (CSOM) goal is to enhance public safety by preventing further victimization through improving the management of adult and juvenile sex offenders who are in the community." In addition to [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.csom.org/faq/index.html), the site has a wealth of information, including [Myths and Facts About Sex Offenders](http://www.csom.org/pubs/mythsfacts.pdf)&nbsp;and [Recidivism of Sex Offenders](http://www.csom.org/pubs/recidsexof.pdf).

[ChildTrauma Academy](http://www.childtrauma.org/)&nbsp;This organization, directed by Dr. Bruce Perry, "focuses on service, training and research in the area of child maltreatment."

This website of National CASA explains what CASA's do, how to become one, etc.

[Crimes Against Children Research Center](http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/)&nbsp;"The mission of the Crimes against Children Research Center (CCRC) is to combat crimes against children by providing high quality research and statistics to the public, policy makers, law enforcement personnel, and other child welfare practitioners." The center is directed by Dr. David Finkelhor, a sociologist and internationally recognized expert on child victimization, including child sexual abuse.

It can be particularly helpful at transforming intrusive and upsetting memories of abuse, and does not require one to talk about what happened in detail (for those avoiding therapy for this reason). The EMDR Institute provides referrals to EDMR-trained therapists around the country (by zipcode) and around the world. You can also find EMDR therapists through the [Find a Therapist](http://www.emdria.org/search/custom.asp?id=2337) service of the [EMDR International Association](http://www.emdria.org/), whose primary objective is to "establish, maintain and promote the highest standards of excellence and integrity in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) practice, research and education."

[Self-Compassion](http://www.self-compassion.org/)&nbsp;Dr. Kristin Neff's site includes scholarly research and exercises for how to increase self-compassion.
