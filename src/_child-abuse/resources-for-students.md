I'm glad you're studying child abuse as part of your school work. It's an issue that's so important but most people would rather not think about it, let alone study it. Hopefully you will find some of what I've provided on my website helpful.

Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to share everything I do know via this website. Nor am I an expert in everything related to child abuse. But I can point you to additional resources that may have what you're seeking, in cases where my site doesn't.
